# The Livescale-toolkit

The livescale toolkit is a set of building blocks for large-scale, interactive
live video stream processing application on Nephele.

The toolkit consists of the following parts:
* livescale-nephele: The Nephele building blocks.
* livescale-messaging: Adapter classes offering a unified interface for connecting to messaging services, such as Google's GCM and the RabbitMQ AMQP middleware.
* livescale-examples/livestream: A demo application showcasing how to use the Livescale toolkit.

## Status
Currently, the toolkit is under development. Due to this livescale-nephele is empty. However the livestream demo application should be working.
